## Technical Approach

The application is built using React and TypeScript, focusing on modularity and user experience. For text extraction, we use PDF.js for PDFs and Tesseract.js for OCR on images. The analysis pipeline processes the extracted text through multiple stages:

1. **Text Extraction Layer**: Handles different file formats with appropriate extractors
2. **Analysis Engine**: Processes text through sentiment analysis and readability scoring
3. **Suggestion Generator**: Creates actionable recommendations based on content analysis

The UI is built with Tailwind CSS for responsive design and uses Lucide React for icons. Error handling and loading states are implemented throughout the application to ensure a smooth user experience.
